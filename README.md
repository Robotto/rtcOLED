# rtcOLED
Datetime from a realtime clock displayed on an OLED display.

Originally mounted as an alarm clock but the display was too bright, now works as a wristwatch: Without the encoder the alarm funtionality is unavailable, but i've left the code in, since it's probably still usable.

.. oh! and there's a touch sensor behind the OLED, connected to one of the solder terminals on the top of the display.
